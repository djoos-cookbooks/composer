## Resources / Providers
This cookbook includes an LWRP for managing a Composer project and one for a global installation of composer packages

### `composer_project`

#### Actions
- :install: Reads the composer.json file from the current directory, resolves the dependencies, and installs them into project directory - this is the default action
- :require Create composer.json file using specified package and version and installs it with the dependencies.
- :update: Gets the latest versions of the dependencies and updates the composer.lock file
- :dump_autoload: Updates the autoloader without having to go through an install or update (eg. because of new classes in a classmap package)
- :remove Removes package from composer.json and uninstalls it

#### Attribute parameters
- project_dir: The directory where your project's composer.json can be found (name attribute)
- package: The package to require or remove when using those actions
- version: The version of the package to require or remove when using those actions, default *.*.* Be careful when uninstalling, the version has to match the installed package!
- vendor: Can be used to combine package and version, deprecated!
- dev: Install packages listed in require-dev, default false
- quiet: Do not output any message, default true
- optimize_autoloader: Optimize PSR0 packages to use classmaps, default false
- prefer_dist: use the dist installation method
- prefer_source: use the source installation method
- bin_dir, overwrites the composer bin dir
- user: the user to use when executing the composer commands
- group: the group to use when executing the composer commands
- umask: the umask to use when executing the composer commands

#### Examples
```
# Install the project dependencies
composer_project "/path/to/project" do
    dev false
    quiet true
    prefer_dist false
    action :install
end

# Require the package in the project dir
composer_project "/path/to/project" do
    package 'vendor/package'
    version '*.*.*'
    dev false
    quiet true
    prefer_dist false
    action :require
end

# Update the project dependencies
composer_project "/path/to/project" do
    dev false
    quiet true
    action :update
end

# Dump-autoload in the project dir
composer_project "/path/to/project" do
    quiet true
    action :dump_autoload
end

# Remove the package in the project dir
composer_project "/path/to/project" do
    package 'vendor/package'
    action :remove
end
```

### `composer_install_global`

#### Actions
- :install: Installs the package in the preferred global composer directory, putting binary symlinks in the preferred global binary directory (see attributes)
- :update: Gets the latest versions of the dependencies and updates the composer.lock file for the globally installed composer packages
- :remove Removes package from the global composer.json and uninstalls it

#### Attribute parameters
- package: The package to install or remove, name_attribute
- version: The version of the package to install or remove when using those actions, default *.*.* Be careful when uninstalling, the version has to match the installed package!
- install_dir: the directory in which to make the global installation, default: see the attributes
- bin_dir: the directory in which to make the symlinks to the binaries, default: see the attributes
- dev: Install packages listed in require-dev, default false
- quiet: Do not output any message, default true
- optimize_autoloader: Optimize PSR0 packages to use classmaps, default false
- prefer_dist: use the dist installation method
- prefer_source: use the source installation method

#### Examples
```
# Install a package globally
composer_install_global "package" do
    version '~4.1'
    action :install
end

# Update the package
composer_install_global "package" do
    action :update
end

# Remove the package from the global installation
composer_install_global "package" do
    action :remove
end
```
