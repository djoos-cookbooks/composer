Resources / Providers
=====================

This cookbook includes an LWRP for managing a Composer project

### `composer_project`

#### Actions
- :install: Reads the composer.json file from the current directory, resolves the dependencies, and installs them into vendor - this is the default action
- :update: Gets the latest versions of the dependencies and updates the composer.lock file
- :dump_autoload: Updates the autoloader without having to go through an install or update (eg. because of new classes in a classmap package)

#### Attribute parameters
- project_dir: The directory where your project's composer.json can be found
- dev: Install packages listed in require-dev, default false
- quiet: Do not output any message, default true
- optimize_autoloader: Optimize PSR0 packages to use classmaps, default false

#### Examples
```
#install project vendors
composer_project "/path/to/project" do
    dev false
    quiet true
    action :install
end

#update project vendors
composer_project "/path/to/project" do
    dev false
    quiet true
    action :update
end

#dump-autoload for project
composer_project "/path/to/project" do
    dev false
    quiet true
    action :dump_autoload
end
```
